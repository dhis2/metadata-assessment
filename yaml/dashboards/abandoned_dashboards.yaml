  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
      In many cases users may create dashboards during trainings, for temporary purposes
      or become inactive users. This may leave many abandoned dashboards in the system.
      Ideally, these should be removed if they are no longer needed in order to keep the
      system tidy.
  recommendation: >
      Users with superuser permission should be able to delete dashboards directly
      by looking up the name. Of course, a determination should be made if the dashboard
      really is no longer in use before they are deleted. For large number of deletions,
      you may need to use a script to delete them through the API. You should also
      confirm that the dashboard is not in use by any push analysis before removing
      it from the system.
