  severity: WARNING
  introduction: |
    Periods in DHIS2 are automatically generated by the system. As new data is entered
    into the system, new periods are automatically created. In some cases, periods
    may mistakenly be created when data is sent to DHIS2 for periods which are in the
    distant past. Different data entry clients may not properly validate for periods
    which are in the distant past, and thus these periods should be triaged to ensure
    that data has not been entered against them by mistake.
  recommendation: |
    If any periods exist in the system in the distant past, you should review the raw data
    either directly in the datavalue table, or alternatively though the pivot tables
    to ensure that this data is correct.

    In many cases, clients may mean to transmit
    data for January 2021, but due to data entry errors, January 2031 is selected. Thus,
    any data in the far future should be investigated to ensure it does not result
    from data entry errors.
